This story is a prime example of "telling" instead of "showing". It's bogged down by clunky exposition and lacks the dynamic storytelling necessary to engage the reader. While the premise of a haunted villa is promising, the execution falls flat.  

Here's a breakdown of the key issues and how to fix them:

**1. The Narrative is Stagnant:** 

* **Lack of Sensory Details:** You rely too much on telling us things like "the air crackled with unseen energy" or "the villa exuded a palpable sense of decay." Instead of telling, show us the decay through descriptions of peeling paint, cracked plaster, and cobwebs hanging from the chandeliers.  Let the reader experience the energy through the characters' reactions – a prickling on their skin, the hairs on their necks standing on end.
* **Weak Character Development:** Eleanor and Barnaby are presented as archetypes rather than complex individuals.  We know they're skeptical and brave, but we don't see their motivations or inner struggles. Show us their reactions to the hauntings, their doubts, their arguments. 
* **Uninspired Dialogue:** The dialogue is mostly exposition-driven, lacking the natural rhythm and tension of real conversations.  "It’s just an old house, Barnaby. There's no such thing as ghosts" is a line that tells us everything we need to know about Eleanor's attitude but doesn't bring the scene to life. 

**2. The Hauntings Lack Impact:**

* **Overreliance on Clichés:** Whispers, shadows, and a creepy woman in white are familiar horror tropes.  You need to make these elements unique to the story and build suspense around them.  What makes the whispering voices so terrifying? What is it about the woman in white that chills Eleanor to the bone?
* **Missing Tension:** The story feels rushed.  The characters confront the Serpent too quickly.  Build tension by teasing the entity's presence –  a flickering candle, a sudden chill, a fleeting glimpse of something unnatural in the shadows – before revealing its full form. 

**3. The Plot is Predictable:**

* **Repetitive Structure:**  Each chapter follows a similar pattern – characters arrive, the villa is creepy, they learn a little about the history, the haunting intensifies.   Introduce subplots, unexpected twists, or red herrings to keep the reader guessing.
* **Lack of Stakes:**  The characters' motives are vague.  Why are they risking their lives for this investigation? What will happen to them if they fail?  Give the characters concrete goals and create consequences for their actions.

**Here are some ways to improve the story:**

* **Show, don’t tell:**  Describe the setting through sensory details.  Instead of "the villa exuded a palpable sense of decay," describe the chipped paint, the peeling wallpaper, the musty smell that clings to the air.
* **Focus on the characters' internal struggles:** What makes Eleanor so determined to prove the supernatural wrong? What are Barnaby’s past experiences that make him believe in the paranormal? 
* **Create dynamic dialogue:** Instead of stating facts, have characters converse naturally, revealing their personalities and relationships through the way they interact. 
* **Develop the haunting slowly:** Don't reveal the Serpent immediately.  Introduce its presence gradually through subtle clues, building suspense and fear in the reader. 
* **Give the characters real stakes:** What will happen to them if they fail? What are they risking? This will create a sense of urgency and make the story more compelling.

By focusing on these points and embracing "show, don’t tell" you can transform this promising story into something truly captivating. Remember, your goal is to create a story that not only tells, but *shows* the reader what it feels like to be trapped in a haunted villa.
